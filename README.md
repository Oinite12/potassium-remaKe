# RE:Potassium
A remake of Potassium, a Balatro mod that has all the bananas and glop you could ever need! Currently the mod adds:

- Glop, a scoring parameter that multiplies with Chips and Mult
- 16 Jokers
- A new Poker Hand
- 2 Planet Cards, 4 Spectral Cards, and 1 Tag
- An Edition and Sticker
- A stake and two special blinds
- Like a secret or two

and more to come!

## Motive for remaking
Potassium was released on April Fool's Day 2025; since then, a lot of breaking changes have been implemented in Steamodded that prevent the original mod from running at all. The original Potassium mod also featured several overriding changes that makes the mod less appealing to play with other mods.

This remake re-implements various Potassium features with modern Steamodded features and improved code. Modularity is also more pronounced so other mods can interface this mod and implement cross-mod content and behaviors easily. Additionally, various content from the original Potassium are subject to reworks, while other content will not be re-implemented; this is to improve balance and cross-mod interactions.

The intent is to ultimately make it easier to develop this mod and add new content that expands on the premise of bananas and glop.
