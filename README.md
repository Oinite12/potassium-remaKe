# potassium-remaKe
***<u>DISCLAIMER: HIGHLY WIP DOES NOT WORK AT THE MOMENT</u>***

A remake of Potassium, a Balatro mod that has all the bananas and glop you could ever need.

## Technical documentation
- Jokers that can evolve with Ambrosia (Banana-themed evolutions) can be implemented by adding a key-value pair the table `Potassium.banana_evolutions`, where the key is the key of the initial Joker, and the value is the key of the evolved Joker.
- Jokers that can evolve with Substance (Glop-themed evolutions) can be implemented by adding a key-value pair the table `Potassium.glop_evolutions`, where the key is the key of the initial Joker, and the value is the key of the evolved Joker.
